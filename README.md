MySQL Performance Analyser

This script is forked from MySQL Tuning Primer and updates it to add more
information. 

This is primarly an update from MySQL Tuning Primer which is not up-to-date
anymore.

Beware though, this is *just* a script and nothing more. The intelligence and
interpretation of the results and advices must come from a human that has a 
minimum understanding of the functioning of the tool and MySQL.

This tool is a fork from tuning-primer.sh which is a good script but not 
up-to-date anymore. I was having a need to have something up-to-date mainly
to report on the MySQL configuration and eventual tuning that may be done.
This script is a _bit_ oriented towards Magento framework, but not that much.

All the work done by the script could be done by hand but hey ... a good
Sysadmin is a lazy sysdamin, right ?
